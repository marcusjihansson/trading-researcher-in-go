```

### **Layered Approach**

1. **Query Enhancement Layer**
   - Expands the user's query into multiple semantically related variations
   - Implemented in `QueryEnhancementModule` within services

2. **Retrieval Layer (Concurrent Sources)**
   - Each source is invoked concurrently using goroutines and a WaitGroup
   - A context with timeout bounds the total wait, ensuring the system stays responsive
   - Implemented in `searchPapers` with a fan-out/fan-in pattern

3. **Fusion & Deduplication Layer**
   - Results from all sources are merged and deduplicated by UID (e.g., DOI, arXiv id)

4. **Scoring & Ranking Layer**
   - Embedding-based similarity (cosine) against the original query
   - Optional heuristic bonuses (keyword overlap, recency, journal impact)

5. **Presentation & Analysis Layer**
   - An interactive terminal flow presents top-ranked items
   - Selecting an item performs an LLM-guided structured analysis
   - After analysis, a prompt offers to print a best-effort PDF/DOI/URL link

üí° FOLLOW-UP ANSWER
============================================================
The Put-Call parity is a fundamental principle in options pricing that states the relationship between the prices of European call and put options with the same strike price and expiration date. According to the paper, this parity can be expressed as:

C - P = S - PV(K)

Where:
- C is the call option price
- P is the put option price
- S is the current stock price
- PV(K) is the present value of the strike price K

This relationship holds under the assumptions of no arbitrage opportunities and the ability to create synthetic positions.

ü§î Answering follow-up question using DSPy-powered analysis...

üí° FOLLOW-UP ANSWER
============================================================
**General Explanation** (Article doesn't cover this specific topic):

A dynamic valuation model for stock options typically refers to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, which revolutionized options pricing. This mathematical model calculates the theoretical value of European-style options using several key inputs:

**Core Formula**: C = S‚ÇÄN(d‚ÇÅ) - Ke‚Åª ≥·µÄN(d‚ÇÇ)

Where:
- C = Call option price
- S‚ÇÄ = Current stock price
- K = Strike price
- r = Risk-free interest rate
- T = Time to expiration
- N() = Cumulative normal distribution function
- d‚ÇÅ = [ln(S‚ÇÄ/K) + (r + œÉ¬≤/2)T] / (œÉ‚àöT)
- d‚ÇÇ = d‚ÇÅ - œÉ‚àöT
- œÉ = Stock price volatility

**Key Assumptions**: The model assumes lognormal stock price distribution, constant volatility, no transaction costs, and continuous trading. While groundbreaking, it has limitations in real markets where these assumptions don't always hold.

**Practical Applications**: Used by traders for pricing, risk management (delta hedging), and identifying mispriced options in efficient markets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required): Your Google Gemini API key
- `BACKUP_MODEL` (optional): Backup AI model for follow-up questions (default: models/gemma-3-27b-it)
- `CORE_API` (optional): Token for CORE v3 API access
- `S2_API_KEY` (optional): Semantic Scholar API key for higher rate limits
- `VERBOSE=1` or `DEBUG=1`: Enable additional debug logging
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: Custom Ollama server URL (default: http://localhost:11434)

### Tuning Parameters
Located in `internal/config/config.go`:
```go
const (
    GeminiAPIBase       = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"
    PubMedAPIBase       = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils"
    EmbeddingModel      = "embeddinggemma:300m"
    GenerationModel     = "models/gemini-2.5-flash"
    DefaultBackupModel  = "models/gemma-3-27b-it" // Backup model for follow-up questions
    MaxResults          = 50   // Articles per source
    TopArticles         = 8    // Articles to display
    SimilarityThreshold = 0.35 // Minimum relevance threshold
)
```

## üîç Source Integrations

The system queries multiple academic sources concurrently:
- **arXiv**: Quantitative finance papers (q-fin categories)
- **Crossref**: Journal articles with DOI metadata
- **Semantic Scholar**: Academic papers with rich metadata
- **CORE**: Open access research papers

All sources are queried in parallel with a 6-second timeout for optimal performance.

### PDF/DOI/URL Link Resolution
After analysis, the system provides the best available link with this priority:
1. arXiv UID ‚Üí `https://arxiv.org/pdf/<id>.pdf`
2. Bare DOI (`10.x/...`) ‚Üí `https://doi.org/<DOI>`
3. Existing URLs (with arXiv abs‚Üípdf conversion)

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### ü§ñ **Intelligent Model Fallback**
The follow-up question system includes automatic model redundancy:
- **Primary Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash for optimal performance
- **Backup Model**: Gemma 3 27B automatically activates if Gemini fails
- **Seamless Switching**: No user intervention required during API issues or rate limits
- **Configurable Backup**: Set `BACKUP_MODEL` environment variable for custom backup models

### DSPy Module Optimization
The system learns from examples to improve query enhancement:

```go
// Add domain-specific optimization examples
analyzer.optimizationData = []models.Example{
    {
        Inputs: map[string]interface{}{
            "original_query": "your research area",
        },
        Outputs: map[string]interface{}{
            "response": `{"expanded_queries": [...], "key_concepts": [...]}`,
        },
    },
}
```

### Embedding Caching
- Reuses embeddings for identical text to reduce API calls
- Task-specific embeddings (query vs document)
- Automatic cache management

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**üö´ "No highly relevant articles found"**
```
Solution: The system uses similarity thresholds (>0.35)
- Try broader search terms
- Use more general concepts
- Check if your query is too specific
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è "Query enhancement failed"**
```
Solution: System gracefully falls back to original query
- Check your API key quota
- Verify internet connection
- System continues with basic search
```

**üîÑ "Rate limit exceeded"**
```
Solution: Built-in rate limiting and model fallback prevent most issues
- System automatically switches to backup model (Gemma 3 27B) if Gemini is rate limited
- Wait 60 seconds and retry for full service restoration
- Check your Gemini API quota
- Consider upgrading API plan for heavy usage
```

### Performance Tuning

**Speed up searches:**
- Reduce `MaxResults` for faster processing
- Lower `TopArticles` for quicker selection
- Increase `SimilarityThreshold` for fewer but better results

**Improve accuracy:**
- Add domain-specific optimization examples
- Customize journal impact scoring
- Adjust similarity calculation weights
